# ActionScript 3 NullPointerException Example

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: a NullPointerException caused by attempting to access a property of a null object. The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version.

The issue arises from situations where an object reference might be null before accessing its properties. This is often due to improper initialization or asynchronous operations where the object might not yet be available.

This example highlights the importance of proper null checks and defensive programming in ActionScript 3 to prevent runtime errors.
